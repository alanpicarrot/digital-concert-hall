# Digital Concert Hall - JWT Authentication Debugging Session

## Issue Overview
- Frontend shows 401 Unauthorized error when attempting to create an order
- Login appears successful but API calls to `/api/orders` result in 401 errors
- Browser console shows POST request failing with status 401

## Root Causes Identified
1. JWT token validation issues
2. Role/authority formatting inconsistencies
3. CORS configuration limitations
4. Security configuration gaps

## Key Changes Made

### JWT Token Enhancement
1. Improved token validation with better error handling:
   - Added detailed logging in `JwtUtils.validateJwtToken()`
   - Enhanced error reporting for different token validation failures

2. Fixed role formatting:
   - Ensured proper "ROLE_" prefix addition when missing
   - Standardized role format to match Spring Security expectations
   - Added role format consistency checks in `getRolesFromJwtToken()`

### Security Configuration Updates
1. Enhanced security filter chain:
   - Added explicit handling for OPTIONS requests
   - Updated authorization checks to handle both `hasRole` and `hasAuthority`

2. Fixed authentication filter:
   - Corrected syntax errors in `AuthTokenFilter.java`
   - Improved authentication context handling
   - Added comprehensive debug logging

### CORS Configuration
1. Extended allowed origins:
   - Added `localhost:8080` and `localhost` to allowed hosts
   - Ensured frontend application access to backend APIs
   - Configured proper header handling for JWT tokens

### Debugging Endpoints
1. Added diagnostic API endpoints:
   - `/debug/auth-status` to check authentication state
   - `/api/debug/auth-status` accessible via API path
   - `/api/orders/auth-test` to verify order permissions

2. Enhanced logging throughout:
   - Added detailed authentication context logging
   - Improved user context visibility in `OrderService`
   - Added request inspection in controllers

## Implementation Notes

### JWT Role Handling
Role format is critical for Spring Security. The `@PreAuthorize` annotations expect:
- Either `hasRole('USER')` (Spring adds "ROLE_" prefix automatically)
- Or `hasAuthority('ROLE_USER')` (explicit prefix required)

Our solution handles both formats by:
1. Standardizing roles in the JWT token
2. Ensuring controllers accept both formats
3. Logging role transformations for debugging

### Authentication Flow
1. JWT token extracted from Authorization header
2. Token validated for structure, signature, and expiration
3. Username and roles extracted from token
4. User details loaded and mapped to authorities
5. Authentication added to security context

## Testing Steps
1. Use the `/api/debug/auth-status` endpoint to verify authentication status
2. Check logs for detailed information on token validation
3. Ensure frontend is correctly sending the JWT token in the Authorization header
4. Verify token has proper role claims

## Common Causes of 401 Errors
- Missing Authorization header
- Incorrect Bearer prefix
- Expired or malformed token
- Missing or incorrect role claims
- CORS configuration issues preventing header transmission
