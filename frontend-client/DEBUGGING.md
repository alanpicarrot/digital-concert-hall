# React Router Debugging Notes

## Issue
The application was encountering an error related to the React Router context:
```
TypeError: Cannot destructure property 'basename' of 'React10.useContext(...)' as it is null.
```

## Changes Made to Fix the Issue

1. **Added explicit basename to BrowserRouter in App.js**
   - Modified `<BrowserRouter>` to `<BrowserRouter basename="/">`
   - This ensures the basename property is defined when components use the Router context

2. **Ensured consistent version of react-router-dom**
   - Installed react-router-dom@6.16.0 to match the version in frontend-client/package.json
   - This helps avoid version conflicts that can cause context issues

3. **Improved error boundary debugging**
   - Enhanced the error logging in ErrorBoundary component
   - This will help identify any future issues more effectively

## Additional Debugging Steps
If the issue persists, consider:

1. Check for nested Router components that could be causing context issues
2. Ensure all components using Router hooks are within a Router provider
3. Look for version mismatches between React and React Router
4. Check for circular dependencies in imports

## Running the Application
Use the included `start-debug.sh` script to clear any previously running instances and start the application:
```
./start-debug.sh
```
